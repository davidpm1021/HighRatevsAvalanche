## ✨ MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH: CALCULATION LOGIC PERFECTED

### 🎯 **What We Just Accomplished**
We completely rewrote the calculation engine to properly handle the fundamental differences between credit cards and amortized loans:

#### **📋 Updated 3-Step Process:**

**Step 1: Apply Interest**
- ✅ **Credit Cards:** Interest compounds monthly (added to balance)
- ✅ **Amortized Loans:** Skip this step (payment covers interest)

**Step 2: Apply Minimum Payments**  
- ✅ **Credit Cards:** **FIXED - Calculate minimum AFTER adding interest** (1% of new balance + interest)
- ✅ **Amortized Loans:** Fixed payment covers both interest and principal

**Step 3: Apply Extra Payments**
- ✅ **Both Types:** Extra payment goes straight to principal
- ✅ **Rollover Logic:** Freed payments from paid-off debts continue

### 🚨 **Critical Fix Applied - Payment Rollover Logic**
**Previous Logic (FLAWED):**
1. Minimum payments from paid-off debts only rolled over for one month
2. Rollover only worked for debts paid off during extra payment phase
3. Total available payment capacity didn't accumulate properly

**New Logic (CORRECT):**
1. Minimum payments permanently increase the extra payment pool
2. Rollover works for debts paid off during ANY phase (minimum or extra)
3. Payment capacity properly accumulates: $400 → $750 → $775 → etc.

**Test Results:**
- Auto Loan ($350 min) paid off → Extra payment becomes $750 permanently ✅
- Credit Card ($25 min) paid off → Extra payment becomes $775 permanently ✅
- Student Loan rollover → Extra payment becomes $1050 permanently ✅

### 🎉 **Why This Matters**
- **Accurate Modeling:** Now matches real-world debt payoff behavior
- **Faster Payoffs:** Users see realistic acceleration as debts are eliminated
- **Proper Avalanche/Snowball:** Methods work as mathematically intended
- **Correct Comparisons:** Strategy comparisons are now truly accurate

## 🧩 Original Project Purpose
Build a fully client-side web app that helps users explore and compare three debt repayment strategies:

1. **Minimum Payments** (no extra effort)
2. **Avalanche Method** (highest interest first) 
3. **Snowball Method** (lowest balance first)

The tool accepts user debt inputs and generates payoff estimates, total interest paid, and duration for each method.

Each method should:

Apply minimums first

Use extra payment based on strategy

Track interest, balances, time, and cost

Functions to build:

calculateMinimum()

calculateAvalanche()
